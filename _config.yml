    Hi! I'm Baris :) I'm a software engineer based in Munich. I'm specialized in Machine Learning applications in Robotics field. I am most proud of the
    Reinforcement Learning for autonomous robotics grasping [project](https://github.com/BarisYazici/deep-rl-grasping), 
    which was featured as Editor's Pick on Towards Data Science publication [link to post](https://bit.ly/3s1srPr).
    
    I am constantly challenging myself with new goals. Recently, I passed the Workera machine learning engineer [certification](https://app.workera.ai/public/candidate/certificate?code=HTAUGOEY).
    I am also learning meta-learning in object-detection field and developing a basic project. Feel free to contact me via <a href = "mailto: baris.yazici@tum.de"> e-mail</a>.
    
    The technologies I am post comfortable with are:

          Learning object grasping from raw depth sensor data with Reinforcement Learning in <mark>Pybullet</mark> simulation.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This project has begun with my master's thesis project- full report can be foud [here](https://github.com/BarisYazici/tum_masters_thesis/blob/master/final_report.pdf).
          I developed the project even further after I handed my dissertation. It evolved to a fully open-source project that aims to help all robotics enthusiast.
          This projects presents a convenient way to train robotics hand for object manipulation. It includes two different scenes(table and plane) to test the trained model.
          It uses <mark>OpenAI-Gym</mark> to describe the environment. It has built-in support for depth, RGB-D and auto-encoder observation. There are trained models in <mark>SAC</mark>, 
          <mark>DQN</mark> and in <mark>BDQ</mark> Reinforcement Learning algorithm.
          
          The trainning structure supports <mark>curriculum learning</mark>, <mark>shaped reward</mark> integration for speeding up the training.

          Controlling the tendons of the Roboy with <mark> PPO </mark> algorithm. Trained the agent on <GCP> in a <mark>Docker</mark> container
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs 
          Roboy's joints are actuated with tendons, akin to humans. It is challenging to control the length of tendon to build to move the joint in a specified problem.
          The traditional control approach suffers to perform, because of the modelling difficulties, such as elasticity of the tendon or the uncertainty of the tendon length
          when it is wrapped around the pulley.

          Therefore we developed an adaptable system with <mark>Deep Reinforcement Learning</mark>. We describe the environment with <mark>OpenAI gym</mark> and trained the
          model with <mark>PPO</mark> algorithm on <mark>Google Cloud Platform</mark>. I implemented the gym interface and the physics simulations helper functions.

          Developed a real-time kinect fusion pipeline for reconstruction and augment reality application. 
          We used Iterative Closest Point(<mark>ICP</mark>) algorithm for camera tracking and marching cubes to extract the meshes.
          Later we transferred the meshes to <mark>Unity</mark> and interacted the world with such as rendering balls or bottles on the reconstructed world.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Roboy is one of the biggest student teams in Technical University of Munich. We are developing a tendon-actuated humanoid robot. One part of the project was to detect the hand with <mark>SSD</mark> model in a real-time video stream from <mark>Leap Motion</mark> camera.
          The other part is the classify the hand with a specific gesture-id. This gesture is then passed to the simulation of the Hand model via <mark>ROS</mark> communication.

          Hand model is develop based on a previous template on <mark>AutoDesk Fusion</mark>

          Sabanci University is a unique university in Turkey, it allows students to select their courses flexibly. Students can easily change their major.
          I took advantage of this system and attended courses from Robotics, Electronics and Computer Science departments. I graduated with 3.25/4 GPA(4 is the max)

          I led the Mountaineering Club between 2014-2015 - [SUDOSK](https://www.instagram.com/sudosk/?hl=en). I organized and led many educational camps in Turkey with over 25 participants.
          I restructured the theoretical climbing education and maintained the official communication between the club and the University.
